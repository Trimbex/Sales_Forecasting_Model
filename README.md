## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd walmart-sales-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sales_forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## üìä Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration & Quality Assessment
- **Data loading** and initial inspection
- **Missing value analysis** (‚úÖ No missing values found)
- **Statistical summary** and data type verification
- **Feature categorization** (categorical vs numerical)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Target variable distribution** analysis
- **Categorical features** visualization and analysis
- **Numerical features** distribution with statistical summaries
- **Correlation analysis** and feature relationships
- **Outlier detection** using box plots and statistical methods

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- **Date processing** and temporal feature extraction
- **Feature engineering** (weekday, month, year extraction)
- **Outlier removal** using IQR method (~8.4% of data removed)
- **One-hot encoding** for categorical variables
- **Feature standardization** using StandardScaler
- **Train-test split** (80/20 ratio)

### 4. Machine Learning Modeling
- **Baseline model** establishment with Linear Regression
- **Feature selection** comparison (VIF, RFE, PCA methods)
- **Multi-algorithm evaluation** across different model families
- **Performance comparison** using R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE metrics

### 5. Time Series Analysis
- **Date reconstruction** from temporal components
- **Data aggregation** to weekly/monthly frequency
- **Stationarity testing** with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- **Time series decomposition** (trend, seasonal, residual)
- **Holt-Winters forecasting** with seasonal components

## üèÜ Key Results

### Best Performing Models

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE ($) | Performance |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **XGBoost** | **0.9511** | **$130,799** | ü•á Best Overall |
| XGBoost (tuned) | 0.9433 | $140,824 | ü•à Second Best |
| Random Forest | 0.9404 | $144,409 | ü•â Third Best |
| Linear Regression | 0.9287 | $157,958 | Baseline |
| Ridge Regression | 0.9287 | $157,955 | Similar to Linear |

### Feature Selection Insights
- **Minimal multicollinearity**: VIF analysis showed manageable correlation levels
- **Full feature set optimal**: All 62 features contribute to model performance
- **Economic indicators crucial**: CPI, Unemployment, Fuel_Price are key predictors

### Time Series Findings
- **Strong seasonality**: 4-month cyclical patterns identified
- **Successful forecasting**: Holt-Winters method captured trends and seasonality
- **Business cycles**: Clear quarterly patterns in sales data

## üí° Business Insights

### Key Findings
1. **Economic Sensitivity**: Sales strongly correlate with economic indicators (CPI, unemployment, fuel prices)
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Quarterly business cycles suggest inventory planning opportunities
3. **Store Variation**: Significant performance differences across 45 store locations
4. **Weather Impact**: Temperature affects customer shopping patterns

### Actionable Recommendations
- **Inventory Planning**: Use quarterly seasonal patterns for stock optimization
- **Economic Monitoring**: Track CPI and unemployment for demand forecasting
